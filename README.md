Automation Script for Slot Availability Checker
Description:

This automation script uses the Selenium Python library to periodically check the availability of interview or appointment slots on a specified website. Once a slot becomes available, the script sends an email notification to the specified email address using the smtplib library in Python.

Requirements:

Python 3.x installed
Selenium Python library installed
Chrome WebDriver installed
A valid email account and SMTP credentials to send the notification email
Instructions:

Install Python 3.x from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.
Install the Selenium Python library by running pip install selenium on the command line.
Download and install the Chrome WebDriver from the following link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.
Clone or download the automation script from the GitHub repository to a local directory on your computer.
Open the script in a text editor and replace the values in the CONFIGURATION section with your own website URL, email credentials, and other settings.
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script by entering python interview_slot_availability_checker.py on the command line.
Leave the command prompt or terminal window open while the script is running to receive email notifications when interview slots become available.
Notes:

The script is set to check for interview slot availability every hour by default, but this can be changed in the CONFIGURATION section of the script.
If running the script on a remote server, it is recommended to use a tool like screen to keep the script running even if the SSH connection is lost.
